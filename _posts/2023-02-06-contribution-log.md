## **Course Website Contribution**
***
* **Date**: 2/6/23  
* [Link to Contribution](https://github.com/joannakl/ossd/issues/43)
* **Description**: I noticed a broken link in the "Introduction to Open Source" slides, so I created a new Issue on the Github repository to report it, as well as tried to explain why I thought the link wasn't working (invalid url).
