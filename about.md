### Basic Info About Me
***
Originally from the suburbs of Philadelphia, I'm currently a senior studying **Business** & **Computer Science** at NYU!

A fun fact (although slightly embarrassing) is that I once fell asleep while running on a treadmill...

### More Information
***
In my free time, I love exploring food places in NYC, working out, watching k-dramas, playing board games, and baking!

Some things I'm interested in / would like to get better at are:
* cooking
* singing
* design (mostly slide & product design)
* running
* learning languages

Last spring, I studied abroad in Singapore and I thought it was one of my best life decisions! A couple weeks ago during winter break, I also went to Australia for 12 days and really enjoyed my time there. So I'd love to keep traveling more places in the future--will take any recs :))
